1)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
	The gitignore file is a plain text document tells Git files to ignore when commiting your 
project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo.

When making commits to any Git repossitory, you'll choose the files you want to stage and then you'll
commit them.
But you might not want to commit every single one of your files, there are files thatnever neeed 
to get committed. This is where the .gitignore file is useful, It tells Git which files to ignore 
and never track.

2)What does fast-forward in git mean?
	when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the 
first commit's history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no 
divergent work to merge together, this is called "fast-forward."

If master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the 
latest commit of the feature branch. This is a "fast forward."

3)Why should you have different branches?
	Using branches help you organize the workflow more efficiently and rather effortlessly.
When you start developing a new feature, you'd create a new branch for it. This way if there's
a bug report in current version, you can go back to the mainbranch, fix the bug there, and 
release an update - and then go back to the new feature branch and continue working.

4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	When you have one single remote repository, it is called "origin" by default.
If we have two or more remote repositories then we should name each of them using unique names.
